`xTuring` provides fast, efficient and simple fine-tuning of LLMs, such as LLaMA, GPT-J, Galactica, and more.
By providing an easy-to-use interface for fine-tuning LLMs to your own data and application, xTuring makes it
simple to build, customize and control LLMs. The entire process can be done inside your computer or in your
private cloud, ensuring data privacy and security.

With `xTuring` you can,
- Ingest data from different sources and preprocess them to a format LLMs can understand
- Scale from single to multiple GPUs for faster fine-tuning
- Leverage memory-efficient methods (i.e. INT4, LoRA fine-tuning) to reduce hardware costs by up to 90%
- Explore different fine-tuning methods and benchmark them to find the best performing model
- Evaluate fine-tuned models on well-defined metrics for in-depth analysis

<br>

## üåü What's new?
We are excited to announce the latest enhancements to our `xTuring` library: Falcon LLM integration and Generic model support. With this update, you can use and finetune Falcon-7B model with the off-the-shelf, off-the-shelf with INT8 precision, with LoRA architecture, and LoRA architecture with INT8 precision. Moreover, in case you do not find a model you want to run in the models' list, you can still us `xTuring` to run with the new `GenericModel` wrapper available to you. This new integration allows you to test and finetune any new model on xTuring without waiting for it to be integrated.

You can check the  [Falcon LoRA INT8 working example](examples/falcon/falcon_lora_int8.py) repository to see how it works.
Also, you can check the  [GenericModel working example](examples/generic/generic_model.py) repository to see how it works.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```bash
pip install xturing
```

<br>

## üöÄ Quickstart
```python
from xturing.datasets import InstructionDataset
from xturing.models import BaseModel

# Load the dataset
instruction_dataset = InstructionDataset("./alpaca_data")

# Initialize the model
model = BaseModel.create("llama_lora")

# Finetune the model
model.finetune(dataset=instruction_dataset)

# Perform inference
output = model.generate(texts=["Why LLM models are becoming so important?"])

print("Generated output by the model: {}".format(output))
```

You can find the data folder [here](examples/llama/alpaca_data).

## üìä Performance

Here is a comparison for the performance of different fine-tuning techniques on the LLaMA 7B model. We use the [Alpaca dataset](examples/llama/alpaca_data/) for fine-tuning. The dataset contains 52K instructions.

Hardware:

4xA100 40GB GPU, 335GB CPU RAM

Fine-tuning parameters:

```javascript
{
  'maximum sequence length': 512,
  'batch size': 1,
}
```

|      LLaMA 7B      | DeepSpeed + CPU Offloading | LoRA + DeepSpeed  | LoRA + DeepSpeed + CPU Offloading |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| GPU | 33.5 GB | 23.7 GB | 21.9 GB |
| CPU | 190 GB  | 10.2 GB | 14.9 GB |
| Time per epoch | 21 hours  | 20 mins | 20 mins |

Contribute to this by submitting your performance results on other GPUs by creating an issue with your hardware specifications, memory consumption and time per epoch.

## üìé Fine-tuned model checkpoints
We have already fine-tuned some models that you can use as your base or start playing with.
Here is how you would load them:

```python
from xturing.models import BaseModel
model = BaseModel.load("x/distilgpt2_lora_finetuned_alpaca")
```

| model               | dataset | Path          |
|---------------------|--------|---------------|
| DistilGPT-2 LoRA | alpaca | `x/distilgpt2_lora_finetuned_alpaca` |
| LLaMA LoRA          | alpaca | `x/llama_lora_finetuned_alpaca` |
