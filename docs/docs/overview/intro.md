# xTuring

**xTuring** is an open-source AI personalization software. xTuring makes it easy to build and control
LLMs by providing simple interface to personalizing LLMs to your own data and application.

xTuring gives you the tools to:
- fine-tune LLMs using different approaches
- generate datasets from your data sources
- evaluate modified models

xTuring prioritizes:
- simplicity and productivity
- efficiency of compute and memory
- agility and customizability

### Installation
```bash
pip install xturing
```
